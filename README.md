# Sound-and-effects
In this project, I built a fast-paced, non-stop side-scrolling game where players have to time their jumps to avoid crashing into incoming obstacles. I also added music and sound effects to make the game more immersive. Creating dynamic backgrounds that keep repeating was another skill I learned, essential for these types of games. Lastly, I figured out how to add cool effects like splatters and explosions, making the game much more fun to play.
